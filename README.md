# tree-visualizer
Tree structures visualizer. You can view video preview here: [youtube](https://youtu.be/pPoPGj-IQHs). I written visualization and all the tree structure by myself, that is, I didn't take anyones code and didn't use third party libs.

Features:
 - AVL Tree
 - RB Tree
 - Splay tree
 - Cartesian tree
 - Add/remove keys to/from the trees
 - QT-made UI

Here you can only find the code for the project, and no build instructions or anything. This was not a concern when I developed this project and it is not a concern now either.
